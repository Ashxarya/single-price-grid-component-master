## My process

I started mobile first and then worked my way up to desktop version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt to work for mobile first.
I used grid more.

### Continued development

Id like to get more into javascript and animations at a latter point.

### Useful resources
